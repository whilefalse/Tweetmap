This is a little app I made while playing about with the Twitter API.

It displays trending topics as a treemap. Due to the limitations of the Twitter API, it uses some incredibly dodgy and innacurate measurements to get the relative importance of trending topics (see for yourself!)

It uses the treemap code from http://monkey.org/~jose/blog/viewpage.php?page=treemappy_0_9, which is BSD licenced.
