This is a little app I made while playing about with the Twitter API.

It displays trending topics as a treemap. To see it in action go to http://tweetmap.sites.djangohosting.ch/

Due to the limitations of the Twitter API, it uses some incredibly dodgy and innacurate measurements to get the relative importance of trending topics (see for yourself!)

This is a Django App, so if you want to run it you'll need to download and install Django - http://djangoproject.com/ and configure your settings.py accordingly.

It uses the treemap code from http://monkey.org/~jose/blog/viewpage.php?page=treemappy_0_9, which is BSD licenced.
